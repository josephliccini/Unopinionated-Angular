# UnopinionatedAngularToolbox

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The demo app supports hot reloading of the source files.

## Build
Run `npm run build` to build the aot version of the library. 
Run `npm run bundle` to build the entire library as a single bundle.
Run `npm run prepublish` to build both the aot version and the bundle version.
The output will be in ./dist.

## Generate Documentation
Run `npm run genDoc` to generate the documentation in ./doc.  This uses [compoDoc](https://compodoc.github.io/website/guides/getting-started.html)
to generate the documentation.  Highly recommended for your Angular documentation needs.

## Deploying to Github Pages
Currently no support for this through a simple command.
